# Node.js Express.js Route Parameter Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Node.js Express.js applications related to handling route parameters. The bug occurs when an application fails to properly handle cases where a route parameter is missing or invalid.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or incorrect responses.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that attempts to fetch a user by ID. However, it lacks proper error handling for scenarios where the `id` parameter is missing or invalid.  This could result in an error when attempting to access a non-existent user or if there's an issue with database interaction (simulated here).

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation with improved error handling, ensuring the application responds gracefully in cases of missing or invalid parameters or database errors.  It incorporates input validation and more robust error handling techniques.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
4. Run `node bug.js` and make requests (e.g., `/users/1`, `/users/abc`, `/users`). Observe the responses.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` and repeat the requests, comparing the responses to identify the improvements.
